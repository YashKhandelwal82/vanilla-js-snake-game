# 🐍 Snake Game – Vanilla JavaScript

A classic Snake Game built from scratch using **pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
This project demonstrates my strong command over JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and game logic implementation without using any external libraries or frameworks.

## 🧠 JavaScript Concepts Used

This project highlights my strong understanding of core JavaScript concepts:

- DOM manipulation & event handling
- Game loop using `setInterval`
- State management (snake position, score, direction)
- Collision detection algorithms
- Array operations (`unshift`, `pop`, `some`)
- Browser APIs (`localStorage`)
- Keyboard input handling
- Modular & readable code structure
